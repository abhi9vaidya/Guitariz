                                answer: "Simply click the 'Start Tuner' button and allow microphone access when prompted. Play a string on your instrument, and the tuner will automatically detect the note and show you if you are sharp (too high), flat (too low), or in perfect tune.",

                                answer: "Yes, Guitariz Tuner uses advanced autocorrelation algorithms to detect pitch with high precision, often within 1 cent of accuracy. It is suitable for professional tuning, intonation setup, and practice.",

                                answer: "Absolutely. The frequency detection range covers deep bass notes (E1 ~41Hz) up to high-pitched instruments. Ensure you are in a relatively quiet environment for the best bass tracking.",

                                answer: "The tool needs to 'hear' your instrument to analyze the sound waves and determine the pitch. The audio is processed entirely locally in your browser and is never recorded or sent to any server.",
